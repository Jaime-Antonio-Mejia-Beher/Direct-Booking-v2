        "This is a stylish space in a quiet neighborhood. It has all of the
        things that you need for an extended stay... The bedroom has a space
        heater/fan that was more than adequate, even on the recent cold and
        rainy days when I stayed there" - Leon

        "Jaime's home is very nice and he is a very thoughtful host. The space
        is super cozy and very well maintained. If we were to have needed
        anything, he would have responded immediately. Even with the holidays,
        he was very clear to say if we needed anything to just ask. Thanks
        Jaime!"- Lilah

        and storage space. I'll definitely try to stay here again if I can." -
