        Here Are A Few Kind Words From Our Past Guests:
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        “The space looks new and clean. As noted in the description, the walkway
        down is steep but we did not have any problems. This is the lower level
        of a house but we did not hear much noise from the level above. The
        location is very convenient to the airport, Denver, mountains, and
        shopping and food.” - Jean

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        “Walking in I was happily surprised at how spacious and well designed it
        was - the pictures don’t do it justice. I loved all the little touches
        that made it a super cozy and restful stay. Jamie was a great host -
        very responsive and helpful! I’d definitely book again!” - Traci

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        “If you have business in NE Denver, or flying in/out of DIA, this is the
        place. Everything was as advertised. Plus it was super neat and
        professionally cleaned and in a very safe neighborhood. Also real close
        to Denver Arsenal Wildlife Refuge which is highly recommended. Also
        recommend Las Margs and Yum Asian Fusion, both of which are nearby.” -
